# JavaScript Basics!
Javascript is the action on our website. It is what gives functionality, without javacript we would only have a static web page.
## Primitive Types: The basic building blocks
- Number: positives, negatives, whole and integers numbers are all consider just numbers. NaN is a numeric value that represents something that is not a number.
- String: is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.
- Boolean: True or False. Use to store yes or no values.
- Null: "intentional absence of any value", must be asigned.
- Undefined: Variable that do not hace an assigned value are undefined.
## Variables (are like labels for values):
With variable we can store a value and give it a name so that we can refer back to it later, use that value to do something, or change it later.  
**var --->** (the old variable keyword).  
**let ---->** holds a variable value, you can change it or reassign it.  
**const ->** holds a constant value, you cannot change it.

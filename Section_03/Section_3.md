# Section 3: HTML The essentials

HTML ---> Hiper text markup language. It is a marking system, which indicates how the page should be structured.

### This languague has a structure.

-`<!DOCTYPE html>` ---> indicates thats a html document.

-`<html></html>` ---> represents the root of an html document. All the information goes inside the open and close tags.

-`<title></title>` ---> -specifies the title on the browser instead of showing the name of the file.

-`<head></head>` ---> -inside of this tags goes all the metadata (fonts, scripts, css files, etc).

-`<body></body>` ---> -goes all the information that the user will see.

### Some tags that helps structure our Web Page

## Lists

-`<ul></ul>` Unorder List. Put the information in a disorderly way.

-`<ol></ol>` Order List. Unlike the unordered list, this tag lists information.

(inside of those tags goes `<li></li>` and inside of them the information).

## Anchor Element

-`<a href="https://www.google.com"></a>` We have the **a** tag that indicates thats an anchor element, and inside we put the path with the href atribute.

## IMG Element

-This tag `<img>` does'nt have a closing tag and to put an image you have to use the src (source) atribute `<img src="">`. Also the img tag uses the atribute **alt** to specified a name o title if the image is not load.

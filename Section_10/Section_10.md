# Resposive CSS and Flexbox
## **FlexBox**: 
Is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows or colums, this allows us to distribute space dynamically across elements of an unknow size, hace the term "flex".  
When we designated to a container the display to flexbox, in that box there are 2 Axis; the main Axis (from left to right) and the cross Axis (from top to bottom)
- Flex direction: flex-start, flex-end, row, row-reverse (main axis), column, column-reverse(cross-axis).  
- Justify content: will align elements along the main axis.  Flex-start, flex-end, center, space-between, space-around. s√†ce-evenly.  
- Flex Wrap: wrap, wrap-reverse.
- Align items: will align elements along the cross axis.  Flex start, flex end, center, baseline.
- Align content: this propertie only work if you have some content wrap. Center, space-between, space-around.
- Align Self: applies to individually elements.
## **Flex Sizing Properties:**
- Flex-basis: defines the intial size of an element before additional space is distributed.
- Flex-grow: Controls the amount of available space an element should take up. Accepts a unit-less number value.
- Flex-shrink: it seem are larger than the container, they shrink according to flex-shrink.
**There is a way to shorthand this values** by using FLEX: flex-grow | flex-shrink | flex-basis.

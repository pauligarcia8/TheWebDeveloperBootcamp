# Section 2: An introduction to web development
### An Introduction to Web Development
The Internet is a global network of networks. In a very simple example we would say that my computer is connected to a router through a cable that travels and connects with another cable and so on, connecting globally and being responsible for carrying things like emails, the web, shared files, game info, etc...
The web (the world wide web) is an information system where documents and other resources are available through the Internet, and are transferred via HTTP (information sharing protocol).
### HTTP Requests
The http request is the action of asking for certain information, the server takes it and is in charge of looking for what I need and builds a page rendering html, css, javascript code so that it is visible to humans.
1. CLIENT: request for something (search for something on wikipedia)
2. WEB SERVER: wikipedia server response with "instructions" (html, css, javascript code)
3. BROWSER: the browser takes those instructions and build the screen for better user experience. 
### Frontend vs Backend
Frontend focuses on what runs in the browser while the Backend focuses on what runs on the server.
What HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT do:
HTML is the structure and content of the page, CSS gives the properties (colors, fonts, sizes, etc.) and Javascript the functionality.

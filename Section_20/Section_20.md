# Section 20: Introducing to Functions
## **Reusable procedures**
- Function allow us to write reusable, modular code
- We define a "chuncj" of code that we can then execute at a later point.
- We use them ALL THE TIME.
### How to define
function funcName () {  
    do something  
}  
## **Arguments**
We can also write functions that accept inputs, called arguments. For example
function greet () {    
    console.log('Hi');   
}   
// Hi  
greet('Tim');  
// Hi Tim  
## **RETURN**
The return statment ends function execution AND specifies the value to be returned by that function.

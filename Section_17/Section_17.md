# Section 17: JavaScript Arrays
## Ordered collections of values
> Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed.
### **Arrays are indexed** ----> days[0] = "monday"
If you want to access any data (such as the letter of a word) of an element in the array, you must specify the location of that element and then the location of the data you need, for example ---> **days[0][0] = "m"**

# The World of CSS Selectors
**Unirvesal Selector:** (*), select the entire document for stylistic purposes (not very common).  
**Element Selector:** select the element that we want to change, `<img>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, etc.  
**Selector List:** we create a list of elements which will be affected by the same style changes.  
**The ID Selector:** a **( # )** is placed before the ID that we have established and that way the changes will only be reflected in the element that has that ID.  
**Class Selector:** a **( . )** It is used in the same way as the # for IDs. The difference is that a class can be used and several elements, and an ID only in one.
